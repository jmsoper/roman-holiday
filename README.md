## Roman holiday
(because sometimes you need an extra holiday.)

Looking for something to celebrate? Check to see if there's a holiday you can celebrate today, or search the calendar for upcoming holidays.

Roman holiday stores a JSON file with descriptions and dates for all Roman holidays (as described by Richard M. Heli at histmyst.org). Text has sometimes been modified.

A tiny API iterates over this file to generate a calendar object which can be searched for a given holiday.

On visiting the site, a user will see the current date, and either a description of the day's holiday, or the date and description of the next upcoming holiday.

Uses express and pug!

## TODO
- [ ] build a navigable calendar to explore all holidays
- [ ] provide simple animations based on holidays
- [ ] add tags to holidays to choose which animations should be shown
